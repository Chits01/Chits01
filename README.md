Introduction

In African culture and traditions, oral tradition is a credible part of the knowledge systems and communication. This is preserved and transmitted through rites of passage and family history. Due to lack of contemporary written records, this article relies mostly on family chronicles, griots, praise poems, chants, folktales, speech, song & dance. This is not a perfect science and it evolves or degenerates with time due acculturation, assimilation and other causes. Contradictions will develop and appear. Yet the core of the story remain the same and it's preserved through the values and principles of cultural and traditional practices. Despite all this, all Mtombe people claim their origins from a common ancestor, Ndlela. It is conclusive that they migrated from eSwatini and they share more than blood but many common practices and history.

Origins

VaTombe are descendants of some of the Ndlela people, a BaNgwane house, who migrated to the country now known as Zimbabwe from Southern eSwatini, from around the late 17th and early 18th centuries. They're named after Mtombe, a granite rock found in Southern eSwatini. The main Ndlela group entered the interior of Rozvi Empire through what is now Mozambique, others through what is now Botswana and others through the Limpopo river at different times. The main group established their official capital at Hanyanya, Bikita. One of the families to emerge from this group was under Bukabaye. This later became Mutsimba Headmanship, a ruling house of the Hanyanya Mtombe Clan. This was in the kingdom of the Moyo Duma people of Mazungunye, who they had an old alliance with under his father Pfupajena. Others followed at different times. While some never reached Hanyanya, they settled in different places, established themselves and stayed in communication. The Ndlela migration story is different from the other Nguni clans who migrated to the Rozvi Empire through effects and impact of Mfecane. The Ndlela migrants arrived in what is now modern day Zimbabwe in three main movements. The first group arrived after the return of the Duma from Uteve. The second group arrived with Queen Nyamazana. The third group seems to have been a result of Mfecane. There were minor migrations in between and later. Their movement was not one major exodus. VaTombe presence in Zimbabwe is shrouded in mystery with supernatural stories & individuals who acquired spiritual and political legitimacy among the Shawasha, the Hera, the Duma & other clans they lived amongst. They rose to prominence as Rain Makers & Fierce Warriors who thrived in secrecy. Their supernatural powers and vast knowledge of medicine propelled them to emerge as a dominant ally to the ruling clans. This also saw them being invited to Njelele to perform and conduct Rain Ceremonies. Some of them remained in Matebeleland until the advent of colonialism. Others remain there until today today. During the war between the Duma and the Rozvi under Jiri & Gumunyu, VaTombe allied with their old coalition, the Duma. In Bikita, VaTombe precided over the ritual and ceremony of the sacred and mysterious bug, Harugwa, on Hanyanya mountain. This earned them one of their Chidawo, Hanyanya.  In time, this role and responsibility was taken over by the Duma. To strengthen their hold onto political power and spiritual authority.

Mutsimba Headmanship

In the ancient times, VaTombe were not subject to any king. Everywhere they went, land was given to them. Upon which they would live outside the jurisdiction of any kingdom or queendom. Hence they were known as Rudzi Rusinga Tongwe. As renowned miners, they chose to live at the base of mountains or along mountain ranges. Until today vaTombe have valuable knowledge and experience in mining and are known as ancient and traditional guardians of mineral wealth. In Hanyanya Bikita, under Chief Mazungunye, VaTombe were given Headmanship under Bukabaye. Bukabaye & his senior wife vaMandiramwidza had the following children : Sambi, Munehasha, Mutaviri, Nyika, Rusheche and Chibete. With the junior wife vaDzanza they had Mutsimba, Muremeri & Chisenga. It is said in other traditions that this Chisenga was not the first one but he was named after one of their ancestors. The Bikita kindred began to split after the murder of Bukabaye who was the head of this particular family. This was followed by succession squabbles between the children of the senior & junior wives. The senior house decided to leave under the eldest son Munehasha (Chikona) and settled in Mupuwa, land of Dzoro. They segmented again others going to Bota, Nhema and Nyakunhuwa. Munehasha settled in Ruvuyu, Bota. Their father had forseen the conflict and instructed his children from the senior house not to spill any blood. This left the eldest son from the junior house to establish the Mutsimba house as the VaTombe dynasty in Hanyanya, taking over from their father Bukabaye. There were other senior VaTombe houses and families in Hanyanya besides Bukabaye and his children. These included the Madzingo, Mseke and Homola houses. They seem to have left at the beginning of Bukabaye's reign and some as a result of the squabbles between Bukabaye's offsprings.

Borders :

Africans used immovable natural landmarks to mark their borders. Mostly mountains, rivers, valleys  or escarpments. On the western side, the borderline between Headman Mutsimba and Chief Mukanganwi is pronounced by Mujiche River. It runs down to the south marking the boundary with Chief Mazungunye. Once in the south, Mujiche River adjoins with Gande River that flows from the eastern escarpment marking the boundary with Chief Nerumedzo on the east. Chivaka River starts exactly at the source of Mujiche River but runs eastern marking the boundary with Chief Charamba on the northern side. Here it connects with Surudzurwi which runs from the eastern slope marking the boundary with Chief Nerumedzo. The rest of the rivers are found within Mutsimba.

Notable Mtombe People :

Bwerinofa

Legend has it that Bwerinofa could not be killed in a direct combat. His talismanic power and military conquest was fabled. He cultivated a record of transmundane abilities that made him an archetype of the craft and invincible. Bwerinofa's principal and most famous supernatural ability was turning himself into a rock, if a battle became intense and against his odds. Making himself invisible to his enemies. Even though Bwerinofa was not a Chief, he was a well known leader and prominent warrior. As was common for such reputable men, he was given a wife to honor him. This wife later sold him out to his enemies. She revealed his secrets and source of power to his foes. In the thick darkness of the night, they sneaked into his home and murdered him in cold blood in his sleep. His enemies are supposed to have remarked 'Bwe rinofa'. Meaning 'A rock can die'. Earning himself the name Bwerinofa. Bwerinofa had the following children : Museve, Manyofa, Muvenge, Dzamera, Chipenyu, Dandara, Chingoni, Matake and Masemure. Museve settled at Gwira under Chief Mapanzure of the Mhofu Shava totem. Manyofa and Muvenge died at VuTombe. The rest of his children migrated to VuTombe and settled there.

Mashavidze 

Mashavidze was one of the most accomplished contemporary seers. His divination work was of religious proportions and verified beyond doubt. His work was revered and highly valued, as a major spiritual reference point in Zvishavane and beyond . A mastered trade passed down to him from his father Chiromonye, who inherited it from his father Msekelintaba. The Mseke House migrated from eSwatini to Bikita. They left Bikita for Filabusi, Fort Rixon, Makhandeni. Where they were removed and driven to Zvishavane by white settlers. Part of their family moved to Mberengwa, Mwenezi, Lupane, and Maguswini. Mashavidze had inherited a lot of Hakata from his father that he used to cast in his practice. Of this lot, 3 were most famous and would be used to ascertain interpretations. The three were named Nhokwara, Chitokwadzima na Chinengwena.  He was not a healer but seer When he passed on, the Hakata were passed down to one of his sons who never followed the work of his forefathers. This was the end of this trade in the Mseke House. Mashavidze passed on in 1963, well advanced in age.

Madzingo Family 

One of the most notable VaTombe is the Madzingo family. It is said that Madzingo is a corruption of the name Amazingo. Meaning rain clouds. A renowned Medicine man from one of the oldest families, tradition has it that Amazingo was the Kingmaker and Rainmaker. Madzingo was a Spirit medium of the Great Ancestral Spirit Amazingo. He accumulated a record of being a medicine man, unmatched by any of his contemporaries. Madzingo sired Mthubuki, Chibango, Magundani, Gava, Ngodho & their sister Nyembesi. Secret family history records the Madzingo brothers carrying family raids in combat actions against their enemies. Leaving a trail of death and destruction if you crossed their path. One such incident took place in Beza. This led to Madzingo brothers taking off with Magundani settling in Sarikai, Gava ending up in Verenga, Chibango moving to Mutema, Ngodho settling in Murinye and Mthubuki moving to Gurajena. Nevertheless, the Madzingo brothers were celebrated for being great warriors and fearless hunters. Even though they inspired awe in others, some people revered while others feared them for their supernatural powers. The Madzingo brothers would plan a raid, attack, conquer and come back home victorious in time for supper the same day.

Nyamande 

According to oral tradition & family history, Nyamande is considered one of the greatest and most accomplished contemporary Mtombe generals. Due to his exceptional military skill and superb warfare, he established a chronicle of military conquest unsurpassed by any of his peers. Nyamande's enemies were in awe of his prowess which he demonstrated in a series of battles against Lobengula at Hanyanya. Nyamande finally met his death in battle after crossing Deure River. It is said as per tradition, Lobengula demanded Nyamande's head.  VaTombe would not relinquish his head nor give up his body. They fought to keep it and give him a decent burial. Nyamande is said to have seen his final resting place in a cave in Mudanda on Mt Twiza. Where he had married into the Rozvi Mahove or Chidangwara house. After Nyamande's burial, his children, Rugora and Chideya migrated and settled under Chief Nerutanga in BuHera. Dhakwa settled in Manjengwa, Gutu.

He married and had his oldest son Chanengeta in the land of Chinemukutu also known as Gutu. His work required that he travel a lot so at his peek he became a nomad.

Umcimbi wakaNdlela

Dispersed due to economic, political, cultural, environmental and vocational factors, Mtombe people are uniting under sustainable development projects & programs, to rebuild their family & community.
There is an ongoing research and development initiative to document, preserve & tell the Mtombe story through various media platforms. Their Culture and Traditions are being renewed through a restoration of their Rites of Passage, Workshops, Camps, Festivals and Celebrations. Building a bridge between generations & creating a legacy for their people and community. Umcimbi wakaNdlela is an annual family festival fashioned in the classic tradition of Mtombe gatherings and story telling. It's a time to rebuild and heal the family. The day is marked by activities that reach deep into Mtombe cultural and traditional values and principles. Resolving family feuds with love, kindness, forgiveness, rites and appeasements. This takes place during the end of November. Mtombe people gather to eat, drink and celebrate family, culture and traditions.

Traditionally every Mtombe person is supposed to use their clan name as a surname. The clan name is the name of the founding father. In the case of Mtombe people their  surname is meant to be Ndlela. This practice was interrupted and in other families stopped due to colonisation and acculturation. A data base is being built to record Mtombe people. This is an ongoing process and will be updated regularly. The following are some of the surnames found amongst the Mtombe people today.
